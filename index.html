    <p>For a long time, I've tried to figure out the direction I want my life to take. A desire for financial independence has always been strong, but I really wanted to do something I enjoy.
      My brother-in-law, who is a front end developer, suggested I try some free coding websites to see if I like it.
      At first, I thought anyone who did this for a living was clinically insane and possibly part robot.
<br>
      Then, I started understanding.
    </br>
      When I was able to figure out a bug on my own, or type in a few characters and create an action in a separate environment, I was a goner.
      I immediately started comparing schooling options, and after a short while, I felt comfortable commiting to Digital Crafts.
      In August, my children will be going to school full time (barring another pandemic) and I've decided to become a developer. As the term developer has many different paths, I'll have to narrow down an exact avenue,
      but until then I'm thoroughly enjoying learning it all. I feel invincible every time I solve an issue with my code. </p>
    <p>This is what I need to accomplish my goal:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Go to Digital Crafts Web Development Boot Camp.</li>
     <li	>Work extremely hard to learn anything and everything I can.</li>
     <li>Build beautiful projects with drop-dead gorgeous code to go in my portfolio.</li>
     <li>Network and fully immerse myself in the IT world and build friendships with wonderful people that will help me grow and learn.</li>
     <li>Get a job as a developer at a company with good, strong ethics.</li>
     <li>Profit!</li>
    </ol>
